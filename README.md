# PIPELINE-PROCESSOR-DESIGN
🔹 TASK–3: PIPELINED PROCESSOR DESIGN

Description:
This task focuses on designing a 4-stage pipelined processor using Verilog HDL. The processor is divided into four stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), and Write Back (WB). It supports basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD. Pipeline registers are used between stages to allow parallel execution of instructions, improving performance. Simulation results demonstrate the flow of instructions through each pipeline stage.
